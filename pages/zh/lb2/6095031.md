This is the third of a four-part tutorial on setting up a mobile backend as a service on Amazon and setting up iOS and Android client applications to enable push notification.  See [Tutorial: push notifications - LoopBack app](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Tutorial%3A+push+notifications+-+LoopBack+app) for information on setting up the server application.

## Overview

This article provides information on creating iOS apps that can get push notifications from a LoopBack application.  See [Push notifications](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/Push-notifications.html) for information on creating the corresponding LoopBack server application.

The basic steps to set up push notifications for iOS clients are:

1.  Provision an application with Apple and configure it to enable push notifications.

2.  Provide a hook to receive the device token when the application launches and register it with the LoopBack server using the `LBInstallation` class.

3.  Provide code to receive notifications, under three different application modes: foreground, background, and offline.

4.  Process notifications.

For general information on the Apple push notifications, see [Apple iOS Local and Push Notification Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction.html).  For additional useful information, see [Delivering iOS Push Notifications with Node.js](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/developing-ios-push-notifications-nodejs).

## Prerequisites

Before you start developing your application make sure you've performed all the prerequisite steps outlined in this section.

*   **[Download the LoopBack iOS SDK](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/DOC/Client+SDKs)**
*   **[Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)**

## Configure APN push settings in your server application

Set up messaging credentials for iOS apps

If you have not already done so, [create your APNS certificates](https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/) for iOS apps. After following the instructions, you will have APNS certificates on your system. Then edit `config.js` in your backend application and look for these lines:

```js
exports.apnsCertData = readCredentialsFile('apns_cert_dev.pem');
exports.apnsKeyData = readCredentialsFile('apns_key_dev.pem');
```

Replace the file names with the names of the files containing your APNS certificates.  By default, `readCredentialsFile()` looks in the `/credentials` sub-directory for your APNS certificates. You can create a credentials directory and copy your pem files into that directory.

**To try a sample client application, follow [Install and run LoopBack Push Notification app](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Tutorial%3A+push+notifications+-++iOS+client#Tutorial:pushnotifications-iOSclient-InstallandrunLoopBackPushNotificationapp).**

**To enable push notifications for your own Android app see [Add LoopBack iOS SDK as a framework to your own iOS Project](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Tutorial%3A+push+notifications+-++iOS+client#Tutorial:pushnotifications-iOSclient-AddLoopBackiOSSDKasaframeworktoyourowniOSProject).**

## Install and run LoopBack Push Notification app

If you want to use the sample iOS client app, download the  [Push Notification Example iOS app](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-push-notification/tree/master/example/ios) .  Then follow these steps to run the app

1.  Open the [apnagent.xcodeproj](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-push-notification/tree/master/example/ios/apnagent.xcodeproj) in Xcode, select targets, under build phases unfold **Link Binary with Libraries**, and click on '+' to add LoopBack framework(LoopBack iOS sdk).
    {% include image.html file="6258800.png" alt="" %}
2.  Edit Settings.plist and update the RootPath to your instance ip. In my case it is - [http://ec2-54-184-36-164.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/api](http://ec2-54-185-155-187.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3010/api)

## Add LoopBack iOS SDK as a framework to your own iOS Project

Open your XCode project, select targets, under build phases unfold **Link Binary with Libraries**, and click on '+' to add LoopBack framework.

{% include image.html file="6258800.png" alt="" %}

The LoopBack iOS SDK provides two classes to simplify push notification programming:

*   [LBInstallation](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-ios/api/interface_l_b_installation.html) - enables the iOS application to register mobile devices with LoopBack. 
*   [LBPushNotification](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-ios/api/interface_l_b_push_notification.html) - provides a set of helper methods to handle common tasks for push notifications.

## Initialize LBRESTAdapter

The following code instantiates the shared `LBRESTAdapter`. In most circumstances, you do this only once; putting the reference in a singleton is recommended for the sake of simplicity. However, some applications will need to talk to more than one server; in this case, create as many adapters as you need.

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.settings = [self loadSettings];
    self.adapter = [LBRESTAdapter adapterWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:self.settings[@"RootPath"]]];

    // Reference to Push notifs List VC
    self.pnListVC = (NotificationListVC *)[[(UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController viewControllers]
                                           objectAtIndex:0];

    LBPushNotification* notification = [LBPushNotification application:application
                                         didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];

    // Handle APN on Terminated state, app launched because of APN
    if (notification) {
        NSLog(@"Payload from notification: %@", notification.userInfo);
        [self.pnListVC addPushNotification:notification];
    }

    return YES;
}
```

## Register the device

```
- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData*)deviceToken
{
    __unsafe_unretained typeof(self) weakSelf = self;

    // Register the device token with the LoopBack push notification service
    [LBPushNotification application:application
didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken
                            adapter:self.adapter
                             userId:@"anonymous"
                      subscriptions:@[@"all"]
                            success:^(id model) {
                                LBInstallation *device = (LBInstallation *)model;
                                weakSelf.registrationId = device._id;
                            }
                            failure:^(NSError *err) {
                                NSLog(@"Failed to register device, error: %@", err);
                            }
     ];
...
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError*)error {
    // Handle errors if it fails to receive the device token
        [LBPushNotification application:application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
}
```

## Handle received notifications

```
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {
    // Receive push notifications
    LBPushNotification* notification = [LBPushNotification application:application
                                          didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
    [self.pnListVC addPushNotification:notification];
}
```
