This four-part tutorial explains how to create a mobile application on Amazon EC2 that can send push notification to iOS and Android client applications:

*   [Part one](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/6095029.html) shows how to use the `slc` command-line tool to create a LoopBack application running on Amazon EC2 to send push notifications.
*   [Part two](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/6095030.html) explains how to setup and create an Android app to receive push notifications.
*   [Part three](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/6095031.html) explains how to setup and create an iOS app to receive push notifications.
*   [Part four](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/6095032.html) explains how to use LoopBack's swagger REST api and send/receive push notifications on your Android and iOS devices.

You can use the StrongLoop AMI as a starting point for building a backend node application using the `slc` command line tool. Using this app, mobile developers can dynamically manage ‘mobile object’ schemas directly from the LoopBack SDK as they are building their mobile app. The pre-built StrongLoop AMI makes it easy for Node developers who’ve chosen Amazon as their infrastructure provider to quickly get up and running.

Now dive in and start on [part one](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/6095029.html)!
