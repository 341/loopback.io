Use LoopBack Definition Language (LDL) to define LoopBack data models in JSON or JavaScript. 

Use `slc loopback:model` command to crete a JSON definition of a model.  For more information, see [Model generator](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/Model-generator.html).

The simplest form of a property definition in JSON has a `propertyName: type` element for each property. The key is the name of the property and the value is the type of the property.  For example:

```js
{
  "id": "number",
  "firstName": "string",
  "lastName": "string"
}
```

This example defines a `user` model with three properties:

*   id - The user id, a number.
*   firstName - The first name, a string.
*   lastName - The last name, a string.

Each key in the JSON object defines a property in the model that is cast to its associated type.  See [LoopBack types](/doc/{{page.lang}}/lb2/LoopBack-types.html) for more information.

You can also describe the same model in JavaScript code:

```js
var UserDefinition = {
  id: Number,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String
}
```

The JavaScript version is less verbose, since it doesn't require quotes for property names. The types are described using JavaScript constructors, for example, `Number` for `"Number"`. String literals are also supported.

To use the model in code is easy, because LoopBack builds a JavaScript constructor (or class) for you.
