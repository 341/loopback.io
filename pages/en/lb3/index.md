## LoopBack 3.0

{% include important.html content="For documentation of the current LoopBack production release (2.x),
see [LoopBack 2.x docs](/doc/en/lb2/index.html)." %}

The latest LoopBack documentation for version 3.0 will be kept here.  Initially, it will largely
be a copy of the [LoopBack 2.0 docs](/doc/en/lb2/index.html), except with release notes
and a few additional "new features."  

We should also try to write a "migration guide"
as soon as possible.  From there, the 3.0 docs will slowly diverge from the 2.x docs
as they (and LoopBack) evolve.
