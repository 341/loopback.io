All breaking changes must be described here. When adding a new entry,
always describe the impact on users and instructions for upgrading
applications from 2.x to 3.0.

## LoopBack core

### loopback-datasource-juggler was moved from peerDependencies to dependencies

Originally, we (ab)used peer dependencies to ensure there is only one instance of loopback-datasource-juggler in the dependency tree,
so that there is only one singleton instance of model registry.
This was very fragile and might not have worked in certain edge cases.

We have reworked loopback-datasource-juggler and connectors to not rely on a single juggler instance anymore.
As the last step, juggler became a regular dependency.

[https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/275](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/275)

When upgrading application from previous loopback versions, simply remove loopback-datasource-juggler from your dependencies.

### Always use bluebird as promise library

In version 3.0, we always use bluebird as our promise library instead of `global.Promise`.
We consider Bluebird API a part of LoopBack API from now on, you are welcome to use any Bluebird-specific methods in your applications.

If you are using LoopBack with a custom promise implementation provided via `global.Promise`,
you will have to check all places where you are using non-standard promise API and update them to use Bluebird API instead.

Please see [Related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/pull/1896) here.

### New method of defining remoting metadata

In 2.0, remote methods were defined as:

```js
methods: {
  staticMethod: {
    isStatic: true,
    http: { path: '/static' }
  },
  instanceMethod: {
    isStatic: false,
    http: { path: '/instance' }
  }
}
```

For 3.0, the isStatic flag is no longer required and will be determined from the method name.
Method name starting with "prototype." will be the same as having isStatic flag set to false.

```js
methods: {
  staticMethod: {
    http: { path: '/static' }
  },
  'prototype.instanceMethod': { http: { path: '/instance' }
}
```

Please see [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/pull/2174) here.

### Remove `Change.handleError`

`Change.handleError` is now removed as it was used inconsistenly for a subset of possible errors only.
All Change methods will report all errors to the caller via the callback.

Use PersistedModel to report change-tracking errors via the existing method PersistedModel.handleChangeError.
This method can be customized on a per-model basis to provide different error handling.

Please see [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/pull/2308) here.

### Remove unused user properties

The following properties are removed from the built-in User model in 3.0:
- credentials
- challenges
- status
- created
- lastUpdated

Developers that are relying on these properties, can redefine them in `user.json` or equivalent model.json as follow:
`json { "name": "MyUser", "base": "User", "properties": { "credentials": { "type": "object" }, "challenges": { "type": "object" }, "status": "string", "created": "date", "lastUpdated": "date" } }`

Please see [Related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/pull/2299) here.

### Remove getters for Express 3.x middleware

Express 4.x stopped bundling commonly-used middleware.
To simplify migration of LoopBack 1.x applications (powered by Express 3.x) to LoopBack 2.x (powered by Express 4.x),
we created getter properties to allow developers to keep using the old convention.

We have removed these getters in LoopBack 3.0, here is the full list of removed properties together with the middleware module name to use instead:

* `loopback.compress` - use `require('compression')` instead
* `loopback.timeout` - use `require('connect-timeout')` instead
* `loopback.cookieParser` - use `require('cookie-parser')` instead
* `loopback.cookieSession` - use `require('cookie-session')` instead
* `loopback.csrf` - use `require('csurf')` instead
* `loopback.errorHandler` - use `require('errorhandler')` instead
* `loopback.session` - use `require('express-session')` instead
* `loopback.methodOverride` - use `require('method-override')` instead
* `loopback.logger` - use `require('morgan')` instead
* `loopback.responseTime` - use `require('response-time')` instead
* `loopback.favicon` - use `require('serve-favicon')` instead
* `loopback.directory` - use `require('serve-index')` instead
* `loopback.vhost` - use `require('vhost')` instead

We have also removed `loopback.mime`, which was always set to `undefined`.

See [loopback#2349](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/pull/2394).

### Remove `loopback#errorhandler`

We have removed `loopback#errorhandler` middleware, users should use `strong-error-handler` directly.

See also strong-error-handler's [options](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-error-handler#options) and the [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/pull/2411).

for more details.

### Always use bluebird as promise library

In version 3.0, we always use bluebird as our promise library instead of `global.Promise`.
We consider Bluebird API a part of LoopBack API from now on, you are welcome to use any Bluebird-specific methods in your applications.

If you are using LoopBack with a custom promise implementation provided via `global.Promise`,
you will have to check all places where you are using non-standard promise API and update them to use Bluebird API instead.

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/pull/790)
for more details.

### DAO.find provides ctx.data in "loaded" hook

When implementing "loaded" hook for `DAO.find` method, we have mistakenly implemented a version that sets `ctx.instance` instead of `ctx.data`.
This defeats the purpose of the "loaded" hook, which is to allow hooks to modify the raw data provided by the datasource before it's used to build a model instance.

This has been fixed in 3.0 and the "loaded" hook now consistently provides `ctx.data` for all operations.
If you have a "loaded" hook handler that checks `if (ctx.instance)` then you can remove this condition together with the branch that follows.

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/commit/30283291?w=1)
for more details.

### DAO.create no longer returns the instance(s) created

While implementing support for promises in `DAO.create`, we found that this method returns the instance object synchronously.
This is inconsistent with the usual convention of accessing the result via callback/promise and it may not work correctly
in cases where some fields like the `id` property are generated by the database.

We have changed the API to be consistent with other DAO methods: when invoked with a callback argument,
the method does not return anything.
When invoked without any callback, a promise is returned.

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/pull/918)
for more details.

### Applying an undefined mixin to a LoopBack model throws an error

When applying an undefined mixin to a LoopBack model, a warning message was logged regarding the invalid mixin,
which needs to be addressed rather than silently ignored.
This has been fixed in 3.0, therefore an undefined mixin applied to a LoopBack model will throw an error that needs to be handled.

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/pull/944)
for more details.

### Remove deprecated model hooks and model events

The following deprecated model events are now removed. Please upgrade your code by using operation hooks in its place.

Model events
* changed
* deletedAll
* deleted

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/pull/965)
for more details.

### Model property names with dot(s) generates an error

Instead of showing a deprecation warning for model property names with dots, for example, `customer.name: 'string'`,
an error is thrown in 3.0 for enforcing use of valid model property names.

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/pull/947) for more details.

### Remove wrapper `DataSource.registerType()`

`DataSource.registerType()` method is removed as it was a wrapper for `ModelBuilder.registerType()` and was deprecated.

See [related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-datasource-juggler/pull/976)
for more details.

## strong-remoting

See also [https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/blob/master/3.0-DEVELOPING.md](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/blob/master/3.0-DEVELOPING.md)

### Invocation for remote method has been changed.

We are deprecating the `SharedClass.prototype.find` and `SharedClass.prototype.disableMethod` for looking up and disabling remote methods in 3.0.
They will be replaced by `SharedClass.prototype.findMethodByName` and `SharedClass.prototype.disableMethodByName`
where you can pass in a static method or a prototype method name.
These new methods will accept a string in the form of "name" for a static method and "prototype.name" for a prototype method.

To find a static remote method:
`findMethodByName('create')`

To find a prototype remote method:
`findMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

To disable a static remote method
`disableMethodByName('create')`

To disable a prototype remote method:
`disableMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

### New error-handler for rest-adapter

The REST adapter (typically created via `loopback.rest()`) uses a new error
handler implementation that provides more secure configuration out of the box.

The `error.status` has been removed and will be replaced by `error.statusCode`, `statusCode` is more descriptive and avoids ambiguity,
users relying on `status` will need to change implementation accordingly.

To replicate old behavior user can specify `config.local.js` as follow:
`js module.exports = { remoting : { errorHandler: { handler : function(err, req, res, defaultHandler) { err.status = err.statusCode; defaultHandler(); } } } }`

The environment setting `NODE_ENV='production'` is no longer supported, production vs. debug mode is controlled exclusively by configuration.
Production environment is assumed by default, the insecure debug mode must be explicitly turned on.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the new handler in
[this comment](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/1650#issuecomment-161920555)

User can specific options in their applications in `config.json` as follow:
`json { "restApiRoot": "/api", "host": "0.0.0.0", "port": 3000, "remoting": { "errorHandler": { "debug": false, "log": false } } }`

#### Production mode

Stack trace is never returned in HTTP responses.

Bad Request errors (4xx) provide the following properties copied from the error object:
`name`, `message`, `statusCode` and `details`.

All other errors (including non-Error values like strings or arrays) provide only basic information:
`statusCode` and `message` set to status name from HTTP specification.

#### Debug mode

When in debug mode, HTTP responses include all properties provided by the error.

For errors that are not an object, their string value is returned in `message` field.

When a method fails with an array of errors (e.g. bulk create),
HTTP the response contains still a single wrapper error with `details` set to the original array of errors.

An example of an error response when an array of errors was raised:

Please see [Related code change](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-remoting/pull/302) here,
and new [`strong-error-handler` here](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-error-handler/).
