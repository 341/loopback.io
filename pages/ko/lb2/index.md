layout: translation

summary:
---

Currently, the sidebar is not implemented, because we are in the process of importing
Korean content from the [old LoopBack docs site](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/ko).
For details, please see [loopback.io issue #37](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/issues/37).

The import process should create a useable navigation sidebar that might be slightly different from the English
navigation sidebar.
