LoopBack is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that enables you to:

- Create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little or no coding.
- Access data from major relational databases, MongoDB, SOAP and REST APIs.
- Incorporate model relationships and access controls for complex APIs.
- Separable components for file storage, third-party login, and OAuth 2.0.

## Background: New documentation site

We're moving LoopBack docs from Confluence to GitHub/Jekyll to enable the open-source community to contribute.  

This site is based on Tom Johnson's [Documentation Jekyll theme](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll).

For a complete list of planned and in-progress tasks, see [tasks in the loopback.io GitHub repo](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/issues).
